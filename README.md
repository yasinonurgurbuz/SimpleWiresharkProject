# Simple-Wireshark-Project
The main purpose of this project is to parses the Wireshark inputs to meaningful sentences. 
Simple Wireshark Output Project is a software project which shows Raw ISUP massages to users. 
The aim of this project is to design and build a tool for company workers use and more in future. 
First of all, the objective takes a base of ITU Q763(ETSI spec) for this project. 
Then it parses the massages and outputs of this massages. This might be showing workers ITU Q763 massages with more understandable user interface.
When I examine the software development part of the project we see that it consists of three main lines. 
First one is the user interface. 
User interface will be created with visual studio and will have human-computer interaction more powerful. This application basically shows user ITU (ETSI spec) massages with their hexadecimal numbers, can see the menu and select which their want.
Second one is database management. 
It will use ITU Q763 (ETSI spec) for this project. 
In this case, the tool has a database which is going to use for parsing. 
The system has all dictionaries which includes ITU (ETSI spec). 
After a while, it will recognize massages with a rule of functions. 
The rule is about Wireshark numbers. Wireshark numbers come with an usual order. 
The order provides from functions that in the software part. 
If there is any errors, device will not show it and will add to database as an “Error”.
The main purpose of this project is to parses the Wireshark numbers to meaningful sentences.
